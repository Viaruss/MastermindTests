# MastermindGame

## WIP

The task:
Write the code for the Mastermind game in text mode and prepare a set of unit tests. 
The application should save the completed game to the database and allow displaying the top 3 games in history. 
Assume that the function for checking the code proposal with the secret code and the database are not available 
(for example, implemented by another team) and therefore should be replaced with doubles. 
All doubles should be implemented in two ways: using the Mockito package and as your own implementation. 
In unit tests, you should verify the correctness of the application's operation, 
including cases such as lack of connection to the database and incorrectly entered data by the user.
